## A/B Testing Project Page

**Project description:** An e-commerce company is looking to improve the conversion rate on its website's product pages by testing two different landing page designs. The company has randomly divided users into two groups: the treatment group, exposed to the new landing page design, and the control group, which continues to see the existing landing page design. Each user's interaction is tracked through timestamps, and a binary "converted" value indicates whether the user completed the desired action (conversion) on the page or not.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
